#### Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

**Issue #8: Default Album Art Not Displayed on Startup**
- **Description**: When the application starts up with no track loaded, the album art area shows a broken image instead of the default sample cover

### Version 3.1.0 - 2025-01-30

#### Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

**Issue #6: Excessive Console Output in Production**
- **Description**: Browser console showed hundreds/thousands of console.log messages during normal operation, making debugging difficult and cluttering the console
- **Root Cause**: All console.log/error/warn calls throughout the application were outputting directly without respecting any logging configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Enabled console interception in both main and renderer processes
  - All console.* calls now routed through the logger system automatically
  - Default logging level set to NONE for clean console in production
  - Added user-configurable logging levels (NONE/LOW/MED/HIGH/DEV) in Settings
  - Real-time logging level updates across all processes
  - Console output now respects user's logging preference
- **Files Modified**:
  - `main.js` - Logger default to NONE, console interception enabled (lines 14-22, 163-165, 510-527)
  - `client/scripts/main-app.js` - Renderer logger setup (lines 6-15, 191-202)
  - `client/scripts/main-preload.js` - IPC bridge for logging settings (lines 47-48, 27-29)
  - `simple-logger.js` - Console interception already implemented (lines 554-613)
- **Benefits**:
  - Clean console by default (no spam during normal use)
  - Easy debugging when needed (set level to DEV)
  - No code changes needed (existing console calls automatically captured)
  - Persistent file logging for troubleshooting
  - User control via Settings UI

**Issue #7: No Version Information Displayed**
- **Description**: Application did not show version number anywhere in the UI, making it difficult for users to know which version they're running
- **Root Cause**: No UI component or menu item to display version information
- **Solution**:
  - Added Help menu with "About Que-Music" dialog showing version and build info
  - Added version display at bottom of sidebar (always visible)
  - Version display is clickable to show full About dialog
  - About dialog shows version, Electron/Node.js/Chromium versions, copyright
  - Added "Open Help" option in Help menu with F1 shortcut
  - Professional native dialog with app icon
- **Files Modified**:
  - `main.js` - Help menu and About IPC handler (lines 89-134, 284-301)
  - `client/pages/index.html` - Version display in sidebar (lines 322-328)
  - `client/styles/layout/sidebar.css` - Version styling (lines 15, 174-212)
  - `client/scripts/main-app.js` - Click handler for version (lines 95-101, 223-230)
  - `client/scripts/main-preload.js` - IPC bridge (lines 12, 30-32)
- **Benefits**:
  - Users can easily see which version they're running
  - About dialog follows desktop app conventions
  - Quick access to version info from sidebar
  - Professional appearance with complete build information

**Issue #3: Multi-Track Playlist Creation Not Working**
- **Description**: When selecting multiple MP3 files (Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click) and right-clicking to create a playlist, only one track was being added instead of all selected tracks
- **Root Cause**: Context menu system only tracked single track selection, no multi-selection support
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented multi-track selection with Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click
  - Added `selectedTracks` array to track multiple selections
  - Created `showPlaylistModalWithTracks` method for batch operations
  - Updated context menu text to show selection count ("Create Playlist with 5 Tracks")
  - Enhanced "Add to Playlist" to handle multiple tracks with progress feedback
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/scripts/ui-controller.js` - Multi-selection logic (lines 8, 2582-2679, 2858-2946, 3532-3575)
  - `client/scripts/playlist-renderer.js` - Batch track addition (lines 422-434, 646-707, 509-557)
  - `client/styles/components/cards.css` - Selected state styling (line 264)

**Issue #4: Excessive Console Logging During Library Scan**
- **Description**: When scanning music library for the first time, thousands of log messages flooded both VS Code console and browser console
- **Root Cause**: Music scanner using console.log directly instead of the logger system
- **Solution**:
  - Updated MusicScanner to accept logger instance
  - Replaced all 17 console statements with appropriate logger calls
  - Logs now respect user's logging level setting (NONE/LOW/MED/HIGH/DEV)
  - All scan logs now go to daily log files instead of console
- **Files Modified**:
  - `server/music-scanner.js` - Logger integration (lines 8-11, 18-267)
  - `main.js` - Pass logger to scanner (lines 22-25, 155-167)

**Issue #5: All Tracks Displayed After Library Scan**
- **Description**: After initial library scan, all MP3 files from entire library were displayed in right pane instead of showing folder structure
- **Root Cause**: `loadMusicLibrary()` was calling `getAllTracks()` and displaying all tracks immediately
- **Solution**:
  - Changed to pass empty array initially instead of all tracks
  - Added empty state with friendly instruction message
  - Right pane now shows "Select a folder from the left to view its tracks"
  - Only loads tracks when user clicks a specific folder
- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/scripts/library-manager.js` - Empty initial state (lines 228-303)

#### Technical Improvements

**Console Interception System**
- Automatic capture of all console.log/error/warn calls

**User Experience**
- Clean console by default (no logging spam)
- Easy version identification from sidebar
- Professional About dialog accessible via Help menu
- Clean initial library view with folder tree
- Batch playlist operations with progress feedback
- Context menu shows selection count
